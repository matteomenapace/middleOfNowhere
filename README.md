# Postcards from the middle of nowhere

A bot on a roadtrip, tweeting postcards from the places it visits every day.

### TODO

- [ ] `Greetings from {region} #{country}` to gain social media juice
- [ ] Have a variety of Tweet starters, not just `Greetings`
- [ ] Tweet coordinates?
- [ ] Photo filters? 
    * [Caman](http://camanjs.com) is throwing tantrums when installing (something to do with `node-gyp`)
    * Using [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) instead
- [ ] Adjust photo URL depending on `zoomLevels`
- [ ] Patch together multiple tiles for a higher photo res?
- [ ] Detect people in photo tiles (portraits in a landscape...)
